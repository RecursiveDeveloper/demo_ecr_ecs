# AWS ECR & ECS deploy with GitHub actions

Deploy a simple GitHub actions CI/CD Workflow into AWS ECR and ECS services. It consists of a Dockerfile to build a Nginx image where an index.html file will be stored in order to display a static web page using ECS as the server by proving a task-definition.json file with all the necessary configurations and ECR as the image registry once the image has been built and pushed.
